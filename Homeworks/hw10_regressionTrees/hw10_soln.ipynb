    "# [ER 131] Homework 10: Classification with Decision Trees\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will build on the methods introduced in Lab 7 that predict qualitative variables. In addition to logistic regression and KNN, decision trees are a powerful prediction method and are relatively easy to interpret. A decision tree can explain exactly why a specific prediction was made. As we'll see in this HW, using a single decision tree to make a prediction often isn't the best performing method. However, ensemble methods such as random forests and bagging use multiple trees to reach a \"consensus\" decision and typically perform better than single decision trees. In this homework, we'll start by building a single decision tree and then see how ensemble methods perform by comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are, overall, a relatively accessible method for predictive modeling since they are used for both regression and classification and can take in both continuous and categorical data. Decision trees are covered in sections 8.1-8.3 of ISLR.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we'll be doing a brief exploration of the CalEnviroScreen dataset and then implement various ensemble methods using scikit-learn. If you're up for an extra challenge, the final, optional Extra Credit section walks through how to make a decision tree from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "It'll be a comprehensive survey of trees and the multitude of algorithms that arise from one tree!\n",

    "When we build a tree, the first thing we need to do is decide how we'll create each split in the tree. The criterion that scikit-learn uses when checking the \"quality\" of a split is called the Gini index (also called Gini impurity). A low Gini index score indicates a near perfect split, and a high score means the composition of classes is nearly the same in both groups.\n",

    "What does that mean? Let's say we create a split for which any census tracts where Groundwater Threats < 3 are on one branch (branch #1), and any census tracts where Groundwater Threats are >= 3 are on another branch (branch #2). If branch #1 consists of only tracts in the highest percentile range, and branch #2 consists of only tracts in the lowest percentile range, this is a perfect split and will get a low Gini index for both branches. However, if branch #1 has a 50/50 split of tracts, and so does branch #2 (i.e. there are both high percentile and low percentile tracts with Groundwater Threats >= 3), then this is a pretty bad split that doesn't really help with classification, and it will get a high Gini index score for both branches.\n",

    "The Gini index is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G = \\sum_{k = 1}^{K}{\\hat{p}_k(1 - \\hat{p}_k)} = 1- \\sum_{k = 1}^{K} (\\hat{p}^2_k)$$\n",

    "where $G$ is the Gini index, and $\\hat{p}_k$ is the proportion of each response class in a split, and $K$ is the total number of response classes.\n",

    "The score isn't too shabby for a tree that was put together pretty quickly! One nice aspect of decision trees is that they're easy to visualize and interpret and with scikit-learn, we can export the an image of the tree. Unfortunately, due limitations on DataHub, we can't output an image directly in a notebook. Luckily, we can copy the code and visualize the tree on [Webgraphviz](http://webgraphviz.com). Run the following cell. Then copy the entire output into the dialogue box on Webgraphvis. You should get a visualization of the decision tree we fit!"

You may have noticed that, although the training scores were extremely high, the validation scores usually weren't as high. This is where ensemble methods (namely, bagging, random forests, and boosting) come in. We call them \"ensemble methods\" because we fit many trees and then aggregate the models to avoid overfitting. The benefits of using ensemble methods may not be immediately apparent with the training and validation data, but might become clearer when we evaluate all our models on the test data at the end of the assignment.\n",

    "Lastly, we'll cover boosting, which is yet another approach to improve a decision tree model. The boosting approach grows a tree slowly. Each boosting algorithm has a slightly different approach, but the general idea is the same behind each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn has two boosting algorithms. We'll focus on `GradientBoostingClassifer`. For your awareness, the other algorithm is `AdaBoostClassifier` (for ADAptive BOOSTing). The adaptive part of the algorithm comes from how it updates the data for each weak model in the sequence; it combines many relatively weak and inaccurate classifiers. So it shines when a regular classifier doesn't perform well with a given dataset. However, it doesn't handle noisy data or outliers well. With our CES 3.0 response variable in this case, our data is basically polarized -- we're taking values from the top and bottom 10% -- which means it might not work as well as we want it to.\n",
