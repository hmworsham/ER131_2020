    "In this lab, we'll cover model selection and regularization (ISLR 6.1-6.2). Before we get into that, let's review what we've done so far in terms of modeling:\n",
    "* in Labs 5-6, we covered linear regression by using ordinary least-squares (OLS) optimization to find the intercept and slope coefficient for a a linear relationship\n",
    "* in Lab 7, we covered gradient descent, which is a way to find the coefficients of a model (in our case, a linear model) by iteratively calculating the coefficients using the gradient (the partial derivative of the model loss with respect to the coefficient) until we find a set of coefficients that minimize the loss function\n",
    "* in Lab 8, we covered cross-validation, which is a way to find out how well a model trained on certain data performs when tested on new data\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection and regularization relate in some way to all of these topics. Model selection and regularization approaches give us a method to select which variables (i.e. features) to include in our model, as well as to select the value of the coefficients that should be associated with those variables. Cross-validation also allows us to select variables by providing a way to compare error across different models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection and regularization are also related to OLS in that they provide different methods for choosing model coefficients. Rather than just minimizing the loss, techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression add a regularization term that penalizes the model if it includes too many features by pushing some of the coefficients to zero or close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization methods like Ridge or Lasso can also work *with* cross-validation - for instance, in this lab, we're going to use cross-validation to tune the hyperparameter $\\lambda$. We will use a random train-test split of the data to see how models with different values of $\\lambda$ perform. Although we don't do it in this lab, a more systematic and rigorous way of evaluating different values of $\\lambda$ would be to compare model performance using leave one out or k-fold cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll focus on Ridge and Lasso regression, focusing on how to implement them and examining their prediction error and the coefficients that result from using these methods."
