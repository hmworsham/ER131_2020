According to the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention, shallower wells are more vulnerable to nitrate contamination from fertilizer, waste, or other sources](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/disease/nitrate.html). Let's explore this relationship by first creating a dataframe called `nitrate` that contains only the Fresno well records that measure nitrate concentrations (NO3N). Then, use [`plt.scatter()`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) to create a scatter plot. You only need to fill in the x and y values by referencing the corresponding column in `nitrate`. Fill in the rest of the functions in the cell below to give the plot an appropriate title and x and y axis labels. Make sure to include units in your axis labels (you can inspect `nitrate` to find the appropriate units). \n",
